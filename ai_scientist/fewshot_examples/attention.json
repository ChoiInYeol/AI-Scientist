    "Summary": "The paper proposes the Transformer, a novel neural network architecture that relies entirely on self-attention mechanisms, eschewing traditional recurrent and convolutional layers. This innovation allows the model to achieve state-of-the-art results in machine translation tasks with significant improvements in both training efficiency and translation quality. The paper includes detailed descriptions of the model architecture, including multi-head attention and positional encodings, as well as extensive experimental results to validate the model's performance.",
    "Questions": [
      "Could the authors provide more detailed comparisons with other recent models not included in Table 2?",
      "What is the impact of varying the number of layers (N) in both the encoder and decoder stacks?",
      "Can the authors provide more insights into the choice of hyperparameters, especially the learning rate schedule and warmup steps?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
      "The paper does not explore the application of the Transformer to tasks beyond machine translation, such as image or audio processing.",
      "The discussion on the potential negative societal impacts of the model is minimal and could be expanded."
